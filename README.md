# Array Cardio Day 1

It's my project for day 4 of Javascript 30 Day Vanilla Js Coding Challenge. In this project I have made some exercises about Array and how to manipulating it 

## Concepts learned

1. Array methods (reduce, filter, map, forEach and sort)
2. NodeList X Array, the diff between those two
3. manipulating DOM
